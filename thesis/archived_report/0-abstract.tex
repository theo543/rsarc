This project aims to implement file corruption repair using Reed-Solomon error-correcting codes.
The code used is an erasure code over the field \GF{64}, implemented using Newton interpolation.

Finite field multiplication is implemented using carry-less multiplication, and division is implemented using the extended Euclidean algorithm.

The implementation is a CLI program that can generate parity data for a given file, and later detect and repair corruption.

The file is split into blocks, and an arbitrary number of parity blocks can be generated.
Repair requires as many intact blocks as there were data blocks originally.
Block corruption is detected using a hash.

The program processes multiple codes at once.
This is necessary, as each code is spread across the file, which would cause a naive implementation to perform a system call for each symbol.

Multithreading is used to speed up the polynomial interpolation and evaluation.
