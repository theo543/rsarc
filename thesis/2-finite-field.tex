\chapter{Reed-Solomon Codes and Finite Fields}

\section{Reed-Solomon Codes}

Reed-Solomon codes are a well-known class of error-correcting codes used in a wide range of applications, from data storage to radio communication.
They are based on polynomials over finite fields. \cite{theory-of-error-correcting-codes}

The code used for this project is an erasure code over the field \GF{64}, implemented using $O(n \log n)$ algorithms introduced in \cite{novel-poly}.

The basic working principle of this type of Reed-Solomon code is the interpretation of data as values of a polynomial evaluated at points ${\omega_0, \omega_1, \ldots, \omega_{k - 1}}$ in a finite field $\text{GF}(2^n)$.
The polynomial is interpolated and evaluated to obtain additional points, which are the parity information used to correct errors.
The combination of data and parity points is called a codeword.

As there is only one polynomial of degree $k - 1$ or smaller passing through $k$ points, any combination of at least $k$ of the original and redundant points uniquely determines the original polynomial.

Because each point must have a different x-coordinate, the field size limits how much data and redundancy a single codeword can contain. In \GF{64}, the limit is effectively infinite.

An erasure code is a type of error-correcting code which requires that the locations of corrupted data are known.
The code cannot be used to discover the locations of corrupted data by itself.
In this case, hashes stored in the metadata of the parity file are used to determine error locations.

Other Reed-Solomon codes do locate errors without requiring hashes, but they are not used in this project, as hashes are a simpler and more efficient solution.

One common code is $\text{RS}(255, 223)$, which is used in CDs and DVDs, and uses 8-bit symbols (in the field $\text{GF}(2^8)$).
The notation $\text{RS}(n, k)$ denotes a code with $n$ total symbols, with $k$ data symbols and $n - k$ parity symbols.
The code used in this project has no fixed $n$ or $k$, they are specified by the user.

The code used in this project is also systematic, meaning that the original data is included in the output.
Non-systematic codes do not include the original data, so the receiver must decode the received codeword to obtain the original data, even if no corruption occurred.

\section{Finite Fields}

Finite fields, also known as Galois fields, are mathematical structures which define addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division over a finite set of elements \cite{finite-fields-2nd-ed}
(as opposed to the better-known infinite fields, such as the rationals, reals, and complex numbers).

A field must satisfy the following properties:

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Associativity of addition and multiplication: $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$ and $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$
    \item Commutativity of addition and multiplication: $a + b = b + a$ and $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$
    \item Additive and multiplicative identity elements: $a + 0 = a$ and $a \cdot 1 = a$
    \item Additive inverses: for every $a$, there exists $-a$ such that $a + (-a) = 0$
    \item Multiplicative inverses: for every $a \neq 0$, there exists $a^{-1}$ such that $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$
    \item Distributivity of multiplication over addition: $a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$
\end{itemize}

The theorems of polynomial mathematics used in Reed-Solomon codes only hold in a field. However, standard computer arithmetic - integer arithmetic modulo a power of two - does not form a field.
Modular arithmetic only forms a field with a prime modulus, so it cannot be used directly for Reed-Solomon codes. The finite field \GF{64} is used instead.

For example, the operation $x \cdot 2$ is not invertible, since the most significant bit is lost.

In a finite field $\text{GF}(p^m)$, where $p$ is a prime number, the elements are polynomials of degree $m - 1$, with coefficients in $\text{GF}(p)$.
For the \GF{n} case, an element in the field is a polynomial with $n$ coefficients, where each coefficient is a bit.

The notation $\omega_i$ is used to denote the integer $i$ converted to an element of the field \GF{n} by interpreting its bits as a polynomial.

Finite field addition is defined as polynomial addition.
In \GF{n}, this is equivalent to XOR, as the coefficients are bits. $x + x = 0$ and $x = -x$ i.e. the field has characteristic 2.

Multiplication is defined as polynomial multiplication, followed by reduction modulo an irreducible polynomial of degree 64 (with $65$ coefficients, where the highest coefficient is $1$).

The irreducible polynomial used for this project is $x^{64} + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1$ \cite{low-weight-polynomials}.
The choice of irreducible polynomial does not affect correctness, and the fields obtained from different choices are isomorphic.

\section{Efficient Finite Field Arithmetic}

The efficiency of finite field arithmetic is crucial for the performance of the encoding and decoding algorithms.

\subsection{Carry-less Multiplication}

\GF{64} multiplication can be performed using only three 128-bit carry-less multiplication operations.
Modern CPUs have support for this operation, as it is useful for cryptographic algorithms, computing checksums, and other applications. \cite{intel-clmul}

By multiplying $a$ and $b$ using carry-less multiplication, we obtain a 128-bit result.
We must reduce the upper bits to a 64-bit result, which can then be XORed with the lower bits to obtain the final result.

This can be done by multiplying the upper bits of the result by the irreducible polynomial.

To understand why this works, consider the process of reduction.
The irreducible polynomial is aligned with each set bit in the upper bits of the result, and XORed with the result.
This is \textit{almost} what carry-less multiplication does.

There is a complication.
A third multiplication is required to ensure full reduction, as the highest bits of the upper bits can affect the lowest bits of the upper bits.

For fields where $x^{n - 1} + 1$ is irreducible, two multiplications would suffice, but this is not the case for \GF{64}.

For example, consider $x^{127} + x^{67} + x^{66} + x^{64}$.
After aligning the irreducible polynomial with the highest bit and XORing, all bits in the upper bits are zero.
At this point, the reduction is complete and should stop.
However, this is not how carry-less multiplication works. It will also process the other three bits, XORing the lower bits with some unnecessary values.

The upper bits of the reduced result indicate where this happened. A third multiplication can cancel out the unnecessary XORs.
The XOR of the three 64 lower bits is the final result.

The justification for the algorithm may seem somewhat complex, but the algorithm itself is very short, simple, and efficient.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Carry-less Multiplication}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{Multiply}{$a, b$}
\State $\text{result} \gets \text{CLMUL}(a, b)$
\State $\text{result\_partially\_reduced} \gets \text{CLMUL}(\text{upper}(\text{result}), \text{POLYNOMIAL})$
\State $\text{result\_fully\_reduced} \gets \text{CLMUL}(\text{upper}(\text{result\_partially\_reduced}), \text{POLYNOMIAL})$
\State \Return $\text{lower}(\text{result}) \oplus \text{lower}(\text{result\_partially\_reduced}) \oplus \text{lower}(\text{result\_fully\_reduced})$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Extended Euclidean Algorithm}

A simple way to compute the multiplicative inverse is to raise the element to the power of $2^{64} - 2$ using exponentiation by squaring.
This was used in the early stages of this project, however it requires $126$ multiplications.
It is still used in a unit test to check the results given by the more complex algorithm.

The extended Euclidean algorithm is an extension to the well-known Euclidean algorithm for computing GCD, which also computes coefficients of Bezout's identity, a linear combination of the inputs that equals the GCD:

\begin{equation}
ax + by = \gcd(a, b) \label{eq:bezout}
\end{equation}

This algorithm is the standard method for computing the multiplicative inverse in finite fields - both for integers modulo a prime and polynomials modulo an irreducible polynomial.

When setting $b$ to the modulus of the field, $gcd(a, p) = 1$ and $py = 0$. \ref{eq:bezout} becomes $ax = 1$, so $x$ is the multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo $p$.

The basic structure of the algorithm is as follows:

\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{High-Level Extended Euclidean Algorithm}
    \begin{algorithmic}
        \State $(t, \text{new\_t}) \gets (0, 1)$
        \State $(r, \text{new\_r}) \gets (p, a)$
        \While{$\text{new\_r} \neq 0$}
            \State $q \gets r \div \text{new\_r}$ \Comment division with remainder, not using the irreducible polynomial
            \State $(r, \text{new\_r}) \gets (\text{new\_r}, r - q \cdot \text{new\_r})$
            \State $(t, \text{new\_t}) \gets (\text{new\_t}, t - q \cdot \text{new\_t})$
        \EndWhile
        \State $\textbf{assert}\ r = 1$
        \Comment $t$ is the multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo $p$
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

See \ref{appendix:euclidean} for details of the implementation.
This algorithm, unlike the $x^{2^{64} - 2}$ method, only uses around $32.5$ multiplications when inverting a random element in \GF{64}.

\subsection{Russian Peasant Algorithm}

The Russian peasant algorithm multiplies two values in \GF{64} without requiring 128-bit integers.
It incrementally performs the multiplication by adding intermediate values into an accumulator, and slowly shifting the values to be multiplied and applying polynomial reduction.

This algorithm is necessary as a fallback for older CPUs which do not support carry-less multiplication.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Russian Peasant Multiplication}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{Multiply}{$a, b$}
\State $acc \gets 0$
\For{$\text{i} \gets 1 \text{ to } 64$}
    \If{$b \bitand 1$}
        \State $acc \gets acc \oplus a$
    \EndIf
    \State $\text{carry} \gets a \bitand (1 \ll 63)$
    \State $a \gets a \ll 1$
    \State $b \gets b \gg 1$
    \If{$\text{carry}$}
        \State $a \gets a \oplus \text{POLYNOMIAL}$ 
    \EndIf
\EndFor
\State \Return $acc$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
