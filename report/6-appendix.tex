\section{Recovery Figures}

To visually demonstrate some limitations of this error correction scheme, the following figures show the use of Reed-Solomon codes to repair bitmap images.

Figure A has 12966 errors and can be repaired, yet figure B has only 3288 errors and cannot be repaired.
This is because the errors in figure A are one contiguous burst, whereas the errors in figure B are many small bursts spread across the image, damaging more blocks than in figure A.

Figure C is the recovered image from figure A.

See the script \texttt{generate\_figures.py} for how these images were generated.
