\chapter{Conclusions}

The file metadata is currently not protected from corruption.
This can be addressed by adding meta-parity blocks among the parity blocks.
Although the metadata is generally small, and therefore unlikely to be corrupted, this is a significant flaw in the current implementation.

The implementation can successfully generate parity data and repair file corruption using Reed-Solomon codes in $O(n \log n)$ time.

Correctness is ensured using unit tests for the IO-free part of the implementation - the finite field arithmetic and polynomial algorithms - and end-to-end testing for the entire encoding and decoding sequence, using simulated file corruption.
